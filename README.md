*CLI Config* is a lightweight library that provides routines to merge nested configs
and set parameters from command line. It contains many routines to create and manipulate
the config as flatten or nested python dictionaries. It also provides processing functions
that can change the whole configuration before and after each config manipulation.

The package was initially designed for machine learning experiments where the
number of parameters is huge and a lot of them have to be set by the user between
each experiment. If your project matches this description, this package is for you!

## Documentation :memo:

Here you can find the [documentation](https://valentingol.github.io/cliconfig) (built with pdoc3).

The old documentation with readthedocs (1.3.6, not up to date) is also available
[here](cliconfig.readthedocs.io).

## Pypi :package:

Here you can find the [Pypi page](https://pypi.org/project/cliconfig/).

## Installation :inbox_tray:

In a new virtual environment, simply install the package with:

```bash
pip install cliconfig
```

This package is OS independent and supported on Linux, macOS and Windows.

## Minimal example :rocket:

See the [*Quick Start*](https://valentingol.github.io/cliconfig/cliconfig.html#quick-start)
section of the documentation for a quick overview.

First of all, make default config yaml file(s) in your project (configs are merged from left to right).
Then you can create a config object from these files in python:

```python
# main.py
from cliconfig import make_config
config = make_config('default1.yaml', 'default2.yaml')
```

Now launch your script with eventually additional config file(s) and parameters by command line.
The additional configs are merged on the default one's then the parameters are set.

```bash
python main.py --config first.yaml,second.yaml --param1=1 --subconfig.param2='foo'
```

**By default, these additional configs cannot add new parameters to the default config
(for security and retro-compatibility reasons).**

See the [*Edge cases*](https://valentingol.github.io/cliconfig/cliconfig.html#edge-cases)
section of the documentation for some edge cases due to implementation.

## Tags :label:

You can add tags `@<tag_name>` at the end of parameters names to activate some features.
See the [*Quick start*](https://valentingol.github.io/cliconfig/cliconfig.html#quick-start)
section of the documentation for a quick overview.

The default tags include:

* `@merge_add`, `@merge_before`, and `@merge_after`: merge other yaml files
  indicating the path
* `@copy`: copy another parameter
* `@def`: safely evaluate an expression to define the parameter value (a lot of
  operations and functions are available)
* `@type:<my type>`: try to convert and check the type
* `@select`: target a sub-config and delete the sub-config in the parent config
* `@delete`: delete the key from the config
* `@new`: allow adding parameters that are not present in default config
* `@dict`: create a dict object that is not a sub-config (see the
* [*Edge cases*](https://valentingol.github.io/cliconfig/cliconfig.html#edge-cases) section)

It is also easy to create your own features and possibilities are endless. The way to do
it are explained in the
[*Processing*](https://valentingol.github.io/cliconfig/cliconfig.html#processing)
section of the documentation.

## How to contribute ðŸ‘·
