# Manipulate configs

To merge configs, you can use `cliconfig.merge_config` function.
It supports unflatten (or nested) dicts like `{'a': {'b': 1, 'c': 2}}`,
flatten dicts like `{'a.b': 1, 'a.c': 2}`, and a mix of both. The dicts will be flatten
before merging. Sometimes you can have conflicts in flatten operation for instance with
`{'a.b': 1, 'a': {'b': 2}}` that have two different values for `a.b`. That's why you
can use a `priority` parameter to choose which value to keep before merging.

You can also save, load and display configs with `cliconfig.save_config`,
`cliconfig.load_config` and `cliconfig.show_config` functions.
